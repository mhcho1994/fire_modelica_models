# FIRE_Modelica
### Cyber-Physical System Models in Modelica
This repository provides **cyber–physical models of robotic vehicles**, including both **aerial (drone)** and **ground (rover)** systems, developed in **Modelica**.  
Each model integrates both *physical dynamics* (chassis, actuators, and sensors) and *cyber components* (control, sensor fusion, communication) to enable closed-loop simulation, reachability analysis, and vulnerability assessment.

## Supported Models

### 1. Rover
The rover model captures full **vehicle dynamics**, including suspension, tire–ground interaction, and drive–motor coupling. On the cyber side, it incorporates **embedded control algorithms**, **sensor fusion**, and **communication delay/fault injection interfaces**, enabling emulations of **cyber–physical vulnerabilities**. For vehicle parameters, please refer to the in-line comments and explanations in the Modelica source files.

This model is based on and extends the approaches described in:

### 2. Drone
The drone model represents a **multi-fidelity quadrotor system** with both **low-fidelity (Lo-Fi)** and **high-fidelity (Hi-Fi)** variants.  
It integrates physical models for **rotor thrust**, **aerodynamic coupling**, and **6-DOF dynamics**, along with cyber modules for **state estimation**, **attitude and position control**, and **networked feedback**.

## Key Features
- Modular Modelica models for *cyber–physical integration*   
- Includes *attack and fault injection hooks* for CPS vulnerability analysis*  
- Compatible with *Python-based orchestration frameworks* (e.g., *CP-Glimpse*, *CyPhER*)

## Applications
- Cyber-physical vulnerability assessment  
- Multi-fidelity simulation studies  
- Formal reachability and risk analysis
