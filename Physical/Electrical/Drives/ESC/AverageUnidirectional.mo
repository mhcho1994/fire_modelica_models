  annotation(Documentation(info="<html><p>Ideal averaged one-quadrant DC-equivalent converter. During positive-current conduction, terminal voltage is modulation*dcVoltage. Zero command retains a zero-voltage circulating path until current reaches zero. At that zero-crossing only, current is projected to zero and terminal voltage follows the supplied back-EMF. This fixed-state realization of ideal blocking avoids changing the DAE index when opening an inductor. There is no current reset on command cutoff. Connect coast to the motor currentZero input so that the motor projects its actual winding-current state at the zero-crossing. This model requires an inductive load and its open-circuit voltage. No PWM ripple, phase commutation, switching losses, current limit or battery model. PWM-cycle discontinuous conduction is not resolved.</p></html>"));
